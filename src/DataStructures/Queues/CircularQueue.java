/**
 * Circular Queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle
 * and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called 'Ring Buffer'.
 * A circular queue permits better memory utilization than a simple queue when the queue has a fixed size.
 * In a normal Queue, we can insert elements until queue becomes full.
 * Itâ€™s used to switch on and off the lights of the traffic signal systems.
 * Apart from that, it can be also used in place of a simple queue in all the applications mentioned in Array queue.
 * @param <T> type of element that will be stored in the Circular queue.
